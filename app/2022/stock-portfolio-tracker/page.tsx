        When I started investing, I just could not find a free and easy way to
        track my stock portfolio. So I built one ðŸ’ª! It features performance
        benchmarking agains the S&P 500, portoflio overview, and even tracks the
        trades of the biggest investors in the world. Let me give you a tour!
      </P>

      <P>
        First up, we have a sheet where you can track all your trades. You can
        enter the date, ticker, type of transaction, number of shares, and price
        per share. This is the only manual input you need to do!{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">
          It's important to note that the other sheets render their data through
          this, so don't mess it up!

      <H1>Portfolio Overview</H1>
      <PostImg
        src="/assets/projects/2022/stock-portfolio-tracker/portfolioOverview.png"
        alt="portfolio overview"
        className="w-1/3 max-w-1/3"
      />
      <P>
        The portfolio overview sheet gives you a quick glance at your
        performance. It shows your total investment, current value, and profit
        or loss. You can also see the percentage of your portfolio in each
        stock, which helps you understand your diversification.
      </P>

      <H1>Position Breakdown</H1>
      <PostImg
        src="/assets/projects/2022/stock-portfolio-tracker/positionsSheet.png"
        alt="positions sheet"
        className="max-w-none"
      />
      <P>
        I bet you are wondering: "Wait a minute, how do I know which stock is
        making me the most money?". Well, this is where I tell you! In the
        "Positions" sheet, you get a detailed breakdown of your portfolio by
        each position.
      </P>
      <P>
        There's some pretty vanilla metrics like percentage gain and position
        size. But my favorite custom metric is the "EPS Yield" metric. This
        shows you how much earnings your shares are entitled to, and what the
        yield is on how much money you paid for those shares. From an owners
        perspective and heavily simplifying, this is as close as a bond yield as
        you can get in the world of stocks. {"("}For you finance nerds, I know a
        better metric would most likely be free cash flow yield.{")"}
      </P>
      <P>
        This metric encourages me to hold stocks for as long as possible since
        the EPS yield will only grow larger the longer you hold {"("}as long as
        EPS grows{")"}. For example, at the time of writing, Warren Buffet is
        yielding 50% on his Coca-Cola stock! Imagine paying $1,000 for a stock,
        and making $500 every year ðŸ˜³.

      <H1>Performance Against S&P500 Tracker</H1>
      <PostImg

      <P>
        From my very brief search on the internet, this tracking your
        performance against an index is most likely locked behind subscription
        pay walls, but I built one here for you completely for free âœ¨. You're
        welcome!
      </P>
      <P>
        The green line is your total gains, while the gray line is how much the
        S&P500 would have gained if it bought and sold the same amount of money,
        but into the S&P500. Hopefully your green line is above the gray line!
      </P>
      <P>
        You can also see this chart in periods of 1 day, 1 month, YTD, 1 year, 5
        years, and the lifetime chart.

      <H1>Follow Super Investor Trades</H1>
      <P>
        Have you ever wondered what the biggest investors in the world are
        buying? Well, I have a section for that too!
      </P>
      <PostImg
        src="/assets/projects/2022/stock-portfolio-tracker/superInvestors.png"
        alt="super investor trades"
      />
      <P>
        On the left side, this table shows you the most recent trades that the
        best investors have made. It provides how many shares they bought, and
        at what price.
      </P>
      <P>
        On the right side, you can get an overview of how the best investors are
        moving as a group. It shows you the top 10 buys overall that all super
        investors made in the quarter.
      </P>
      <P>
        You might be wondering, how do I get this data? Most data providers
        would charge an arm and a leg for this information. I simply just found
        a handy dandy website called{" "}
        <PostLink href="https://dataroma.com/">Dataroma</PostLink> that keeps
        track the 13F filings of any investor with at least $100 million in
        assets. Then I use good old fashion web scraping, which Google Sheets
        surprisingly kinda supports.

      <H1>Conclusion</H1>
      <P>
        I built this tracker out of pure necessityâ€”and honestly, just for fun.
        What started as a personal project to manage my own investments turned
        into a tool I use every day, and now, you can too. Whether you're just
        starting your investing journey or you're deep into tracking performance
        and analyzing superinvestor moves, I hope this tracker helps bring
        clarity, confidence, and maybe even a bit of excitement to your
        portfolio.
      </P>
      <P>
        If you have ideas for features or improvements, feel free to reach out!
        Iâ€™m always looking to make it better. Until then, invest wisely and keep
        that green line above the gray one ðŸ“ˆ.
